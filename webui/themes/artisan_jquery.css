/* artisan_jquery.css */

/**************************************************************
 
OK, I think I have it figured out for jqueryUI 1.11.2

After downloading the full build with "no theme" you end
up with a pair of files that are the same, with the exception
of comments:

    jquery-ui.css
    jquery-ui.structure.css

Normally, if you selected a build with a theme, there would
be another file called jquery-ui.theme.css. And normally,
jquery-ui.css would contain jquery-ui.structure.css AND
jquery-ui.theme.css, and all you would need to include is
jquery-ui.css.  Got it?

Then I managed to download all the themes to a /themes
subdirectory.  Each of these downloaded themes contains a
ANOTHER (differently ordered) version of jquery-ui.structure.css
as well as another "combined" jquery-ui.css file, but it also
contains a theme.css file that would seem to be loadable on top
of just the jquery-ui.structure.css.

    /themes/dark-hive/theme.css

It is not clear to what degree "building" a jqueryUI download
might modify the javascript itself, or the structure.css,
according to the theme, but to begin with, I HAVE to assume
that it doesn't

THEME ROLLER

So then you can do ANOTHER build with "Theme Roller". Probably
at some point in the past, ThemeRoller just downloaded the
'stylistic' portions (not the structure) in a "theme" css file,
but now, apparently, you have to do a "build" and extract the
relevant file(s) from the download.

So after I did a build with a custom theme and downloaded it,
I get the same structure.css file, but a jquery-ui.theme.css
file that *probably* contains just the stylistic elements, ala
the /themes directories' "theme.css". It also creates, I presume
another stupid combined jquery-ui.css file.

    /custom_zip_file/jquery-ui.theme.css
    
    
WORK TO DO

- major pain in the ass - somehow figure out if all my assumptions
	 are correct.  Compare various sturucure.css files, etc
	 
- use jquery-ui.1.11.2.structure AS IS

- from the TOP, this file, artisan_jquery.css contains styles
  overriden from jquery-ui.structure.css, as needed

- create the themes I want, artisan_jquery_black.css and
  artisan_jquery_white, based on the dark-hive (for black)
  and the theme I downloaded from themeroller (for white)

  copy themes/dark-hive/images to a new /webui/images directory

- remove the jquery-ui.1.11.2 directory.  It is not needed except as
  a container for themes. The JS files go to
  
		jquery/jquery-ui-1.11.2.js    and
		jquery-ui-1.11.2.min.js,
  
  and structure.css goes to
  
		jquery/jquery-ui.structure.1.11.2.css and min.css.

  the whole jquery-ui-1.11.2 directory is then marked as unused



FINAL RESULTS

  So, the final order of css loads is as follows:

  jquery/jquery-ui.structure-1.11.2.css
  artisan_jquery.css (this file)
  artisan_jquery_black.css (or white)
  artisan.css
  renderer.css, etc
  artisan_black.css (or white)
