/*******************************************
 car_test.css
*******************************************

Test styles used in an alternate test version of the car_stereo UI

The goal is to remove sizing and styling information and rely
on the easyUI defaults, while still providing the proper UI
on both the desktop and the car_stereo.

The file car_test.html is an attempt to use the generic artisan
css files (with desktop_black.css theme) to provide a car_stereo
UI that does not rely on scaling every element up in size, and
an attempt to solve the problem that the native easyUI elements
are too small on the car_stereo

Thus, to begin with, this file is empty

/* override the easyUI panel-title class
 * to make the accordian divisions in teh
 * artisan menu bigger for car-stereo touches
 */

.panel-title
{
	font-size:14pt;
}

/* make the renderer_list bigger for
 * touch on the car-stereo. 
 */
 
.datagrid-cell
{
	font-size:13pt;
}

/* a temporary style to make static text
 * in the car-stereo menu larger
 */



/* Which brings up the whole notion:
 *
 * I think it might make sense to tweak the easyUI defaults
 * (like above) so that they look good (are big enough)
 * on the car stereo, and then just use those styles in the
 * desktop UI unless otherwise neccesary
