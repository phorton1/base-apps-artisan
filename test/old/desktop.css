The specific styles used in the desktop version of the webUI

This file contains the sizing and styling information specific
to the desktop layout, and is currently experimental, and in flux.

The goal is to remove sizing and styling information and rely
on the easyUI defaults, while still providing the proper UI
on both the desktop and the car_stereo.

But for the time being, the car_stereo has a 'fixed' version
of this, as does the desktop.

The file car_test.html is an attempt to use the generic artisan
css files (with desktop_black.css theme) to provide a car_stereo
UI that does not rely on scaling every element up in size, and
an attempt to solve the problem that the native easyUI elements
are too small on the car_stereo
